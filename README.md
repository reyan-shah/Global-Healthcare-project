# Global-Healthcare-project
📖 Overview

This project explores the Global Healthcare Dataset using SQL to uncover insights into global disease patterns, healthcare resources, and socio-economic factors.
Through a series of analytical SQL queries, this study highlights health disparities, disease outcomes, and correlations between income, healthcare access, and urbanization levels across different countries.

🧠 Objectives

The main goal of this project is to:

Analyze global disease prevalence and mortality rates.

Evaluate healthcare accessibility and resources worldwide.

Examine socio-economic factors influencing healthcare outcomes.

Strengthen SQL querying, aggregation, and analytical skills.

🗂️ Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Global Healthcare Statistics
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malaiarasugraj/global-health-statistics

Contents Include:

Country, Year

Disease Name & Category

Age Group, Gender

Prevalence Rate, Mortality Rate, DALYs

Healthcare Access (%), Doctors & Beds per 1000

Average Treatment Cost, Urbanization Rate, Per Capita Income

🧩 Key SQL Questions & Insights
🩺 Disease-Level Analysis

Q1: Find the top 5 countries with the highest average prevalence rate of diseases over all years.
Q2: Find the countries with the lowest healthcare access (%).
Q3: List the top 10 diseases with the highest global mortality rate.
Q4: Find the disease category (Infectious / Non-Communicable) with the highest average DALYs.

👨‍⚕️ Age and Gender Analysis

Q5: Find the most affected age group for each disease.
Q6: Identify which gender is more affected by cardiovascular diseases globally.

🏥 Healthcare Resource Analysis

Q7: Find countries with less than 1 doctor per 1000 people and less than 2 hospital beds per 1000 people.
Q8: Compare average treatment costs across different treatment types.

💰 Socio-Economic Analysis

Q9: Analyze if per capita income is correlated with healthcare access (%) for each country.
Q10: Find the average prevalence rate in countries with high urbanization (>70%) versus low urbanization (<30%).

🧮 SQL Concepts Used

GROUP BY, ORDER BY

AVG(), COUNT(), SUM()

CASE WHEN conditions

Self Join and Subqueries

Correlation & Comparison Queries

Conditional Filtering and Aggregation

📊 Key Findings

Certain non-communicable diseases have the highest DALYs globally.

Low-income countries show significantly lower healthcare access and doctor availability.

There’s a positive correlation between per capita income and healthcare accessibility.

Urbanized countries generally have lower disease prevalence rates compared to less urbanized ones.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

MySQL – Data querying and analysis

Excel / Power BI – Data visualization (optional)

Kaggle Dataset – Data source

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can reveal global health inequalities and support decision-making in healthcare policy and resource allocation.
It strengthened my expertise in SQL data analysis, dataset exploration, and problem-solving using real-world health data.

💡 Next Steps

Build a Power BI Dashboard to visualize key findings.

Expand the analysis to include year-over-year trends.

Explore machine learning models for predicting health outcomes (future goal).
